# GitHub Tutorial

This repo aims to serve as a short and sweet tutorial for GitHub, to introduce the main features to people who have never used Git before. The basic concepts are applicable to other Git hosts (GitLab, BitBucket, Gitea, etc) as well as the command line. It was originally created to help train students working with us on projects with us [NottSpace](https://github.com/cubesats), but is available to anyone who may find it useful :)

If there's any suggestions, feel free to make an issue or PR to discuss it
